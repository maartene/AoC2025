- After reading the description, I felt dishearted. A packing algorithm sounded complicated, especially if it needs to be fast. A DFS probably wouldn't work.
- However, after looking at the solutions on Reddit it seems that the input does not really require packing at all. Just counting how much cells there are in total under the tree and how many the presents would eat up based on their bounding box (i.e. 9) was enough.
- The sad thing is, this works for the actual input, but not the example input :(
- Anyway, I got to improve the code using a Regex and was able to add it to the shared library. Thats always nice.
