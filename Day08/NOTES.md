- ❌ ERROR
- ⚠️ TODO

## Findings
- It took a while to fully understand the question. In particular, that you should only pair up junction boxes a set number of times. Otherwise you always end up with one big circuit
- Also, you should start with every junctionbox being its own self contained circuit
- Once that was clear, it was actually pretty easy. Part 1 took way more time than part 2.
- Afterwards, used object calesthenics to improve the code by getting rid of primitives and wrapping collections.
