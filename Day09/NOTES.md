- ❌ ERROR
- ⚠️ TODO

- Part 1 was pretty easy
- For part 2 I rather quickly had an algorithm that would eventually find the solution. 
    - It worked for the example input
    - However, this one was impractical for the actual input
    - I tried various optimization:
        - Greedy algorithms
        - Other data structures
        - Math (the polygon is actually a split oval)
        - "Pen and paper" search
    - A collegue suggested a C# based solution, that I eventually ended up porting to Swift
